'''
This example demonstrates the usage of snmpwalk, and snmpbulkwalk
methods of fastsnmpy package.

snmpwalk, just provides an interface to net-snmp's python-bindings.
On top of it, this also provides a way to run queries in parallel
using multiple workers. This greatly speeds up snmpwalk's operation.

snmpbulkwalk, is a fastsnmpy method. By performing get-operations
in bulk, it greatly enhances the speed of snmpwalk. It also reduces
the number of packets sent to/from the end device, thereby
decreasing chattiness of the session.
This method also supports the 'workers' attribute, to parallelize
snmpbulkwalk operations for a much quicker run.
