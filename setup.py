'''Fastsnmpy is a module that leverages python-extensions that come
with net-snmp and provide highly parallelized faster-methods to walk
oid-trees on devices.

In addition, it provides a method to bulkwalk mib-trees. BulkWalk
methods are missing from native python-bindings for net-snmp. By
creating a wrapper around the GetBulk method instead, and maintaining
state while traversing the oid-tree, fastsnmpy provides a clever
solution to bulkwalk oids much faster.

It provides the following methods as of Fastsnmpy-1.2.3

- snmpwalk(): Native python-bindings distributed with
  net-snmp, combined with fastsnmpy's ability to parallelize
  snmpwalk operations.

- snmpbulkwalk(): Ability to snmpbulkwalk devices, which makes
  it several magnitudes faster than net-snmp's implementation of snmpwalk.

  By leveraging the getbulk method, this module provides a quick
  snmpbulkwalk utility.

- PROCESS-POOLS: By passing in a 'workers=n' attribute to the above
  methods, fastsnmpy can instantiate a process-pool to parallelize
  the snmpwalk and snmpbulkwalk methods, resulting in several devices
  being walked at the same time,
  effectively using all cores on a multicore machine.

- One-Line, and Two-Line scripts that enable you to discover/walk
  all devices in a whole datacenter

- Both Linux and Windows support
